Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer:
Software engineering involves the design, development , testing, deployment and maintenance of high quality software systems using a systemtic application of engineering principles, methods and tools of development
Software engineering's importance in the technology industry is in the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including in comeerce, healthcare, communcation etc

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer:
Development of programming languages like C
Establishment of software engineering as a disciplice in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer:
Requirements Phase- in this phase, engineers gather and document users' needs and system requirement
Design Phase- in this phase, engineers create high-level and detailed designs of the software architectur and UI
Implementation Phase- in this phase, engineers write code and builf the software according to the design specifications
Testing Phase- in this phase, engineers conduct various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment Phase- in this phase, engineers releases the software to users
Maintenance Phase- in this phase, engineers provide ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer:
In waterfall methodology, it follows a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards wile in Agile methodology, its follows an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change
Examples of scenarios where waterfall methodology would be appropriate includes when developing a loan processing system where it has a stable requirements and can't be tolerate frequent changes due to regulatory constraints
Examples of scenarios where Agile methodology would be appropriate includes in game development because it allows for constant testing and refinement based on user feedback

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer:
Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
QA Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executng test plans
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer:
IDE such as Visual Studio and Sublime provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code
VCS such as Git tracks changes to source code and coordinate work among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer: 
Tight deadlines
Changing Requirements
Technical Debt
Strategies to overcome includes;
  Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines
  Effective communication
  Prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer:
Unit Testong is the testing of individual coomponents or modules of the software
Integration Testing is the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems
System Testing is the testing of the entire software system 
Acceptance Testing is the testing of the system against user requirements to ensure it meets the user's need



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer:
Prompt engineering is writing questions/input/ statements with the aim of getting the best possible responses from the AI model
Its helps in writing clear and precise queries in order to get the best most desired output from the AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer:
Vague prompt:Who was the 3rd president?
improved Prompt: Who was the 3rd president of the republic of Kenya?
Its more effective because it narrows down to a specific country "Kenya" out of all the countries in the world from which the AI will give a definite answer of the specific country in question
